# 1.1.4 Machine Interpretation of a Program

## Session Overview

This lecture introduces the notion of decomposition and abstraction by specification. It also covers Python modules, functions, parameters, and scoping. Finally, it uses the Python assert statement and type 'str'.

## Check Yourself

### What is decomposition?

Decomposition breaks a problem into self-contained, manageable parts.

### What is abstraction?

Abstraction allows us to ignore the details of a piece of code, and use it as a black box - input x, get y.

### What is the difference between formal and actual parameters?

Formal parameters are the names of variables used inside a procedure; actual parameters (or arguments) are the values to those names.
