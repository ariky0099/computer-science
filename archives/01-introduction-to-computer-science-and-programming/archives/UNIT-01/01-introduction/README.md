## Check Yourself

##### What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge?

Declarative knowledge is statements of fact; imperative knowledge is "how to" knowledge.

##### What is the advantage of a stored-program computer?

It's far more versatile than a fixed-program computer, since it interprets a program given to it and carries out those instructions, as opposed to being to do one thing.

##### What are syntax, static semantics, and semantics of a language?

Syntax determines whether a string is legal, static semantics determine whether the string has meaning, and semantics assigns a meaning to a legal sentence (assuming no static semantic errors).

##### What sorts of errors can occur in a program?
It can crash, run forever, or give a wrong answer.
